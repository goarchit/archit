1) Contemplate the wholeness of allowing non-dnsseed locations to act as seeds.
+ Helps decentralize
~ Requires addition of an "addnode" like flag and/or configuration record
- May impact project reputation if seeds come and go

2) Add ability to pre-test pingability prior to uploading, e.g. tweak ones priority list.
   Consider how long of a sorted list is really needed.

3) Discuss round-robin over Rapture nodes vs over entire list.

4) Balance reputation system - automatic ping bumps is probably NOT a good idea since scammers
   will likely always be available
