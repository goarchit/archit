Known items to currently pending for one reason or another:

3) 1/7/2017 - Add code to allow configuration file to override defaults ONLY if not overriden on
command line (posted on go-flags github as an issue)

Thoughts:  Build a pre-opt with just the long and short flags and no default.  Call.  Read config file.  Use IsSet() for precidence.  Call a second time with a nice description and defaults to A) process --help and B) set defaults.  Use second structure to set any previously unset values in first.
