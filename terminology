Hashing:  Converting a long string into a short one.  Good hash algorithms will dramatically change
the results even if a single bit is change in the source string.
Blake2B:  The hashing algorithm used to create a unique 128 byte string for every 1GB file slice
File Slice:  A 1GB portion of a file desiring uploading to the network
File:  A source input file broken in File Slices
RaptorQ:  A forward error correcting code (FEC) formalized by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF)in RFC 6330.  This code was inspirational in designing the FEC used by Archit
Source block:  One of 32 blocks a File Slice is broken into
Source symbol: An encoded portion of a source block.  RaptorQ's is limited to 56403 source symbols 
per source block with each symbol limited to 64KB in size.  This exceeds our target 32MB source block 
size by over 100X.
Transfer Length: size of a complete file slice, after all headers are included.  RFC 6330 limits this
to ~881GB, which might not meet our needs, which is why files are sliced instead of transmitted whole.
