Blake2B:  The hashing algorithm used to create a unique 128 byte string for every 1GB file slice

Encoding:  The process of creating shards, involving RaptorQ like duplication of original data
into a series of blocks ready for encryption

Encryption:  Use of an AES encryption algorithm to render data useless to anyone without the
encryption keys.

GB:  Gigabyte - 1024*1024*1024 bytes, NOT 1000*1000*1000!!!

Hashing:  Converting a long string into a short one.  Good hash algorithms will dramatically 
change the results even if a single bit is change in the source string.

IMACredit:  A cybercoin used as currency by the project (http://www.imacredit.org)

File Slice:  A 1GB portion of a file desiring uploading to the network

File:  A source input file broken in File Slices

RaptorQ:  A forward error correcting code (FEC) formalized by the Internet Engineering Task 
Force (IETF)in RFC 6330.  This code was inspirational in designing the FEC used by Archit

Shard: A 32MB portion of a File Slice, or one of the redudnant blocks created during encoding

Source block:  One of 32 original 32MB blocks a File Slice is broken into
