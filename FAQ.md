Q1)  What is this project about?
A1)  Read the readme.MD file!

Q2)  What coin is going to be used for payment?
A2)  IMACredit  (https://github.com/imacredit/imacredit - https://www.imacredit.org)

Q3)  Do I need an IMACredit wallet?
A3)  As of 1/2/2017, Yes, since no exchange list IMACredit.  Once one does, you could use an
     exchange address if they permit it, but we still recommend a local wallet.

Q4)  Why IMACredit?
A4)  #1 Developed by the same team 2+ years ago.  #2 Stable.  #3 ASIC resistant so little fear
     of a hold & releae (where a scoundral leverages a massive ASIC pool to overwhelm the coin,
     blocking normal users from finding a block for a month, then releasing all the locally
     found blocks while maintaining over half the network hash - just a variation on the 51%
     problem).  #4 A blockchain several years old that would be hard to hack from the 
     beginning. #5 Not currently on an exchange, which provides some flexibility come test time

Q5)  Why Go?
A5)  Easy to read compiled language (more efficient than say something based on node.js) with
     built-in networking, multitasking, and inter-process communication capabilities.

Q6)  Why not just use Storj.IO?
A6)  Read the readme.MD file!

Q7)  Why did this start out in a private repository on Github?
A7)  Authors wanted to have something working before releasing to the world

Q8)  Does my wallet need to be on the same machine?  
A8)  No.  By default the code will look on the local machine, but you can override with a
     dns name or IP address in the configuration file.  Likewise for IMACredits default RPC
     port (64096)

Q9)  Do I need to use port 1958 for archit?
A9)  No, it is overrideable in the configuration file.

Q10) Is there a chat board for this project?
A10) Yes, currently hosted at http://farmbase.carpenter-farms.us:3000, plans are to host it
     at http://chat.archit.it eventually (domain pending on project progress)
